# To-Do DApp on Ethereum

This project is a simple To-Do application built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to test scalability with `web3.js` using a CDN. 

## Overview

Just checking the capabilities of `web3.js` and its integration with PHP while creating a straightforward To-Do app. Trying something different other than node.js and endless npm modules. Also checking if I can comfortably build scalable apps without heavily depending on node.js. I may get ideas for cool web3 toolings. 

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: SQL
- **Web3 Integration**: JavaScript (using CDN)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
